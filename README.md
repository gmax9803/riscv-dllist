## Submitting

1) You should include all the files in a .zip file. These will include:

A PDF with your report **(see above)**. It must be a PDF since text editors often have issues rendering images if done on a different OS. In the past, TAs have marked points off because the image simply didn't render on their machine, so the work wasn't shown.
Five separate assembly files to demonstrate the run at that part
- `dllist_step1.S`
- `dllist_step2.S`
- `dllist_step3.S`
- `dllist_step4.S`
- `dllist_final.S` - Students have submitted the final with copies for each test for the final. This is acceptable, although the TA will be asked to make a change and run the code, so it is not required.

2) Only one group member needs to submit the ZIP file. (In fact, do not have multiple members submit. This inevitably causes confusion among the TAs.) You must include all group members (and Notre Dame emails) on the first page of the PDF. This is how the grading TA will input the remaining marks.

3) Upload to the Canvas Speedgrader listed under Assignments at the following link: https://canvas.nd.edu/courses/82217/assignments/257852
